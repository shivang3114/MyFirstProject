TestNG---Its a unit testing framework and it also called as TDD(test driven development)framework
TDD-Test driven framework
Purpose-----design test cases in a systematic way.

TestNG---open source,available in the form of jar files.
It is also called as --Java unit testing framework.
Both JUnit and TestNG are used only on JAVA. For each language having own framework.


Features:

It will generate good "HTML reports"
--different annotations
--prioroties/sequence
--dependency
--grouping
--data provider (most important feature)

Install TESTNG in Eclipse
after installation good to go to write test cases.
TestNG never needs main class.
Never write main method inside the TESTNG

What is annotations?
Each and every annotations should start with "@"
each and every annotation should associate with one method.

TESTNG contains three sections/annotations
1.Pre-conditions
2.TEST CASES
3.Post Conditions

Note-execution sequence of each and every annotations that will be different.

How many test cases in this SCRIPT?
If one @TEST is available in script it means only one test cases in present 
@Test shows how many test cases available in the script.

Execution Pairs in TestNG(if 3 test cases is available then 3 pairs will create and each and
every pair would start only from----@beforeMethod
@BeforeMethod
@Test
@AfterMethod

How many different annotations available in TESTNG?
There are different annotations 

1.Pre-requite annotations.
@BeforeSuite
@BeforeTest
@BeforeClass
@BeforeMethod

2.Test case annotaions.
@Test

3.Post conditions annotaions.
@AfterMethod
@AfterClass
@AfterTest
@AfterSuite

Note--In real time we are not using all these annotations only few will use.
Note--While creating class in testNG framework use "TEST" keyword for good practice.
e.g. GoogleTest
     AmazonSearchTest
     
Note: to create a framework you can use @beforeMethod,@Test, and @afterMethod
note:Test cases are always independent.

How you will define the sequencing of test cases?
We have one keyword "Priority" keyword immidately after @test write the priority.

                How to find the report in TESTNG basic report or index.html project?
After the execution every time you have to refresh your project then test output folder
will be created inside the test output folder this "index.html" will be available and
automatically it will be created.
Right click on it
Go to properties
Copy the location(this location will be somewhere in your workspace or in your machine or
c-drive ,d drive) 
Copy this location
Paste in your browser or URL tab.              

                     groups(keyword)
   we can see the test report according to the group vice.
  e.g groups="links"
      groups="buttons"
      groups="images"
      groups="dropdowns"
      groups="mousemoveractions classes"
      groups="frames"   
how you will define grouping in TESTNG?
With the help of "groups" keyword.


                   dependsOnMethods(keyword)
some test case is dependent on other test case.
for.eg in "Login" test rest of the functionality is dependent if its failed no need to
test rest things and it wont'allow to test next test.

e.g. My first test case "login" got failed and if it is failed and we know that next
test case is totally dependent on first test case then TESTNG will skip next test case
because it is dependent on "LOGIN" test case.
And in result it will show 1 test case failure and 1 skip
if 5 test case depends on "Login" test case so after execution it will show as
TESTRUN=6
FAILED=1
SKIPS=5

E.G2---If independent test case has been passed and dependent test case has been failed
it TESTNG won't skip any test case to run just consider as failure test case and same 
will populate in file.

                                invocationCount
to execute n number of times to use this keyword  .
e.g. @Test(invocationCount=10) 
                                 
                            invocationTimeOut=2
 if infinite loop in you code so it will help to resolve this issue but never use this
 type of exception in your framework it won't good.
 Always break the loop.
 
Question--How you will handle exceptions in TESTNG?what is a keyword
Answer--We have "expectedExceptions" keyword
                      
Question--If you  want to handle exception without Try/Catch block how u will handle?
we have expectedExceptions keyword we can use in testNG to handle this.

NOTE:Although we are not using execption we can keep as failure the test case but this
is a feature that we should know.

  //Validation is very important in TESTNG
  Assert.assertEquals(title,"Google","title is matched")

 how to run all the classes in one shot in TESTNG?
 We can create one XML file inside the SRC folder and enter all the class name inside the
 XML file and it will run.
 We have default format that we can use.
 
 How to create
 Right click on SRC folder
 Go to the other
 Select file
 Enter name as testng.xml   (this is a name 99% using this name this is a xml template.
 Tags will be available
 INSIDE THE <Classes> tag mention class name and run this 
 It will run all suite the testng
 
 
             @Parameters in TestNG:

What is @Parameters annotation in TESTNG?
ans: I dont want to hardcode my value and it is not a good practise to enter in script
so we will add details in "TESTNG.XML" FILE

                                      TESTNG.XML FILE
WE have default format that we can use to create file
1.First add the testng.xml file
2.Add class name  and in class name add Package name also
e.g. class_name=login
     Package_name=com.TestApplication
 <class_name="com.TestApplication.login"/>  
 
 How to add parameters in xml.file?
 <parameters> tag  name value />
 
 e.g. <parameter name="environment" value="QA" />    (which parameter u want to execute)
   <parameter name="browser" value="chrome"/>      (which browser u want to execute)
   <parameter name="url" value="https://www.freecrm.com"/>  
   <parameter name="username"  value="shivpath"/>
   <parameter name="password"  value="Metnet1993#" />
   
   these are called ENVIRONEMT VARIABLES these things is generic or common things
   or called as configuration parameters.
   
How to pass parameter from testng.xml to TestCases?
How to configure testing.xml file with <Parameter> tag?
Run your test cases with testng.xml file?
