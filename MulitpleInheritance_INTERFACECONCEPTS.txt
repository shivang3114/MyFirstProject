Interface:

//1.only method declaration
	//2.no method body- only method prototype
	//3.in interface, we can declare variables,vars are by default static in nature
	//4.varaible value cannot be changed---its final in nature.
	//5.No static method in interface.-- WHY?
	//6.Inerfaces are part of OOP concept language & its part of objects and objects cannot have static methods thats why we never write static methods.
	//7No main method in interface.
	//8.We can not create the objects of interface	
	//9.Interface is Abstract in nature.
        //10.Abstract means we cannot intanscet/ we cannot create object of the intrface.

How to create relation between Interface and Class?
By using "implements" keyword.

i am the owner of ICICI bank and I want to open a one branch in US, then US will tell you have to follow some
rules and regualation which is availble in one interface then ICICI sayd Ok we dont have any problem we are ready.


Inteface is little bit differerent from inheritance concept we can achive multiple inheritance.
It means child class can implement multiple interfaces. 
But in Inheritance child class can inherit only and only one parent class.
