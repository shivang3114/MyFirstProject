array-to store similar data type  values in a array varaible

//one dimensional array	
	//array is used to store similar data types values in one variable
	//lowest bound/index=0
	//upper bound/index=n-1(n is the size of array)
		
	//disadvantage of array:
     //1. size is fixed--static array----to overcome this problem we use collection---Arraylist, HashTable---these things are called  dynamic array.
	 //2.it stores only similar data types  (e.g int,etc)--to overcome this problem,we use Object array,
		

//to print all values of array  always use looping concepts.

//Object array: (Object is a class-it is the most super class in Java)
		//this is used to store mulitple type of data types.
