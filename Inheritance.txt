inherit some properties from parents but parent cannot 

e.g parent class cannot access child class methods.

NOTE--Granparent--parent--child
child class can access granparent methods also if parent has extends granparant methods.

Whenevr method is common in parent and child class then prefrence always given to child class.---in this condition preference will given to child class


when same method is present in parent class as well as child class with same name and same number of arguments is called method over-riding.



package inheritance.java;

public class TestCar {

	
	
	public static void main(String[]args) {
	
	//call the car and bmw class
	//as these are non-static methods we can call with refrence to the object
	
		BMW obj= new BMW();
		//this method is available in parent and child class both in this condition jvm will give preference for the child class always because it says
		  // you have your own method dont inherit this class and it will execute your own class.No need to over-riddden this class
		obj.start();     
		obj.start();
		obj.stop();           //parent class method
		
		obj.Speed();          //child class method
	    obj.automaticGear();
	    
	}
