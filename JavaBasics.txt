JAVA BASICS:

/primitive data types-----int,double,char,boolean
//after declaration only java can print the values.Because without declaration java is unknown the data and variable.
//Yellow lines is a warning---e.g you have declare a variable but not using consuming memory.

//2.double-to store floating values use double data type keyword.
//3.charcter---it should be single digit value and enclosed always in ''  single quotes
Note:Integer we can store in double but "double" we cant store in INTEGER.


//4.boolean
		//it will always return below values or either 0 or 1 also sometime.
		//Ques:true and false in value or keyword in JAVA?
		//ans:yes these are values but already avilable in java.


//5. String----is a class not a data type but we can use as as data type to store string values.
