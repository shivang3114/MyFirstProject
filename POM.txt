POM without page factory.

POM is just a design pattern not a framewrok
As the name says we will be working as pages (pages will be pure Java classes)
Based on application behaviour we will be creating separate pages and will store all the locator and respective
method to use them

                         Advantage
Script will be more readable format
Using pom YOU you will be able to achieve three feature
   1. Easy to maintain
   2. Readable format	
   3. Reusable scripts.
